# Current Problems
- **Room start/cleanup is incorrect** — `server/core/room_genie.py` calls `gmLauncher.launch_room` and immediately runs `_watch_room` in the same thread (lines ~81-98), so the handler blocks and never returns a response once the game starts. It also mixes allocators (launcher allocates its own port; `RoomGenie`’s `port_allocator` argument in comments is unused), does not register running rooms beyond the launcher map, and never frees ports/tokens on normal exit except via the blocking loop. Result: room creation/start will hang the request, ports can leak, and joiners have no reliable host/port/token registry.
- **Socket object sent in JSON payload** — `user/api/user_api.py:create_room` places the live socket `self.conn` into the JSON payload (lines ~76-78). The JSON encoder will throw `TypeError: Object of type socket is not JSON serializable`, so room creation currently cannot work. The server handler also stores `conn` on the `Room` object, which is not used elsewhere and should be removed.
- **Launcher hard-codes client config** — `server/core/game_launcher.py` imports `user.config.user_config.HOST_IP/HOST_PORT`, binding the server process to client config and localhost defaults. The launcher should use server-side settings; as written, report callbacks and host fields will be wrong off-box and create a circular dependency on the user client package.
- **Version metadata/model is incomplete** — `server/core/game_manager.py` stores `version` as an integer but manifests use strings; there is no game_id/status (ONLINE/OFFLINE) and `get_game` simply returns the latest by `game_name`. Duplicate names across developers collide, there is no “latest” flag, and downloads always take the single latest row. The server does not expose per-version listings, nor enforce semver strings, so updates/rollbacks are undefined.
- **Player start/download flow is brittle** — `user/api/user_api.py:start_game` assumes the manifest already exists locally (no download guard), uses `cfg.HOST_IP` instead of the host returned by the server, and launches clients even if the room metadata is stale. Download paths in `DownloadWizard` are shared (`user/downloads/...`) with no per-username isolation, so multiple players overwrite each other’s installs.
- **Reviews/ratings are missing** — `server/core/reviews.py` is empty and the player UI never shows ratings. The store cannot meet P4 (add/list reviews, average score), and game detail responses contain no review data.
- **Stubs left unimplemented** — `user/launcher/user_launcher.py` is a stub (just `subprocess.Popen()` with no command), and `developer/packaging/manifest.py` / `developer/packaging/packer.py` are empty, so documented flows for launching clients or packaging games are not actually available. README.md is also empty beyond the title, leaving no setup/run guidance for demo.
